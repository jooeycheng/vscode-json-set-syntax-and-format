## Why?

As a dev, I often find myself having to human-parse random JSON (from server logs, Chrome network inspects, etc) as part of everyday debugging processes.

Usually, I have to run 2 separate commands - set language to JSON, then format document. I've always wanted an extension which does exactly these two steps as one. Finally, after many months, I decided to build one which works!
